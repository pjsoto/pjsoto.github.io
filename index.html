				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>The project aims to evaluate and develop domain adaptation methods to the generalization improvement of deforestation detection techniques in remote sensing images.</p>
				<h1> Introduction </h1>
				<p>Over the last decades, much of the effort involved in deploying automatic image classification algorithms has been invested in designing 
				an manually selecting custom features for a target application. Recently, Deep Learning techniques have become the dominant trend in many applications being the main reason for such success the ability
				of these methods to automatic learn representative features directly from data.</p>
				
				<p>Although recent years have witnessed an increase of Earth observation data, remote sensing labeled data still short of the demands imposed by 
				Deep Learning based techniques, mainly beacause of the high costs involved in field survey and the required labor-intensive visual interpretation.</p>
				
				<p>With this in mind, innumerable ideas had been proposed. Transfer learning [1][2] and unsupervised deep learning techniques, such as Stacked Denoising
				Autoencoders [3], Convolutional Autoencoders [4] and Deep Belief Networks [5], emerged as attractive alternatives. Recently, Melgani et al [6], proposed an alternative
				learning strategy based on SVMs called Convolutional SVMs (CSVMs), extending the use of SVM classifier to act as convolutional filter for the supervised 
				generation of feature maps in image categorization problems and bringing as main adventage the use of less training samples for the learning stage. However,
				the results obtained by the latter work on deforestation detection applications were poor in terms of its precission which was demonstrated at Ortega et al [12].</p> 
				
				<p>Another well known deep learning techniques problem is the generalization capability of the networks. In this regard, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been applied
				in the past years in order to alleviate the aforementioned problem. Mostly used on changing environments like the ones faced by self-driving cars, 
				DA methods have greatly benefited Semantic Segmentation performance on these challenging environments. As example we can cite the works
				proposed by Zhu et al [10], Murez et al [11] and others that have applied Cycle GANs [10] aiming to adapat the domain of unseen images to the one used in the training
				of the classifiers.</p>
				
				<p>Motivated by this scenario, this project wants to apply DA approaches on deforestation detection applications, hypothesizing that the performance of the 
				classifiers will increase when new satellite images were evaluated.</p>
